# Acciona Skill Center Robotics, Data & AI Projects

This repository contains the projects completed for the Acciona Skill Center Robotics, Data & AI (Roads and Turtles) Beca program. Each project focuses on different aspects of data science and machine learning, utilizing Python and Jupyter Notebooks for implementation. The repository is divided into two main sections: `roads` and `turtles`.

## Projects Overview

### Roads Project

#### Description
This project involves the development of an autonomous vehicle system focused on traffic sign detection and semantic segmentation. The project is divided into the following tasks:
1. **Plan Description**: Discussing the tools, data, evaluation methods, and challenges.
2. **Implementation**: Coding the traffic sign detection system.
3. **Evaluation**: Testing the system on provided videos and analyzing its performance.
4. **Optional**: Implementing and evaluating a semantic segmentation algorithm.

#### Directory Structure
- **data**: Contains datasets related to the project.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter Notebook for the project.
- **videos**: Videos used for system evaluation.
- **src**: Source code for the project.

### Turtles Project

#### Description
This project aims to predict the number of turtles captured by fishermen using machine learning models. The project includes:
1. **Exercise 1**: Predicting the number of turtles captured by week and zone for the years 2019 and 2020.
2. **Exercise 2 (Optional)**: Identifying which desalination plant corresponds to the provided data based on turtle capture predictions and boron levels.

#### Directory Structure
- **data**: Contains datasets related to the project.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter Notebook for the project.
- **videos**: Videos used for system evaluation.
- **src**: Source code for the project.
